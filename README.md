The project is made by Artem Riabchikov & OpenAI based on hyperskill.org project "Cinema Room Manager" using Kotlin.
To make this project, I used open github project of github user marckoch.
Description from hyperskill: 
Cinema has been a part of the entertainment industry for a long time: a good movie is a way to escape reality and live through a variety of emotions.
The best cinema experience you can get is probably in a cinema theatre.
In this project, you will create an application that helps manage a cinema theatre: sell tickets, check available seats, see sales statistics, and more.
